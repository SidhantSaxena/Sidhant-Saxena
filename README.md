## Projects

### Hand Sign and Gesture Recognition
- **Static Signs (A-Z)**: Using **CNN (AlexNet)** for classification of hand signs after image preprocessing.
- **Dynamic Gestures (e.g., "hello", "thank you")**: Implemented **LSTM** for recognizing gestures over time by learning temporal dependencies in hand movements.
**Mediapipe** is integrated for hand tracking, helping to detect and normalize hand positions for both static and dynamic gestures:
- **CNN + Mediapipe**: Used for static alphabet signs.
- **LSTM + Mediapipe**: Used for dynamic gestures.
- The system is integrated into a **Flask web UI**, allowing real-time hand sign and gesture recognition.

### Music Genre Classification
This project classifies music into 10 different genres (pop, blues, rock, jazz, etc.) using the **GTZAN dataset**. The approach includes:
- **Dataset**: The **GTZAN dataset** with 1,000 audio tracks (30 seconds each) across 10 genres.
- **Feature Extraction**: **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** was used for extracting features from the audio files.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and statistical analysis on the MFCC features, and visualized feature distributions for better insights.
- **Model**: Built an **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** using the sklearn library to classify the genres based on the extracted MFCC features.
- **GUI**: Developed a **GUI using PyQt5**, allowing users to upload audio files and predict the music genre in real-time.

### Yelp Rating Prediction
- Developed a model to predict Yelp ratings (1-5) using BERT embeddings and TF-IDF (unigram + bigram).
- Built an ensemble of Logistic Regression, KNN, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers.
- optimized hyperparameters for all base learners for ensemble learning.
- Conducted error analysis to refine predictions and understand misclassifications.

### Football Objects Detection

- Objective: Developed a real-time object detection system to identify key elements in football gameplay, including players, the football, and referees, using YOLOv11.
- Technology Stack: YOLOv11, Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- Dataset: Curated and annotated a dataset consisting of football match footage, ensuring diverse scenarios and lighting conditions for robust detection.

### Bank Management System
- Designed a system using SQL and Java with a Swing-based UI.
- Leveraged the file system in C for data management.
- Incorporated features for account management, transaction tracking, and reporting.
